# LINUX FUNDAMENTALS

## üß† What is a Kernel?

The **kernel** is the **core part of an operating system (OS)**.
It acts as a **bridge between hardware and software**, managing how applications use the computer‚Äôs resources.

You can think of it as the **‚Äúbrain‚Äù or ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the OS**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Responsibilities of a Kernel

1. **Process Management**

   * Creates, schedules, and terminates processes.
   * Decides which process runs on the CPU and for how long.

2. **Memory Management**

   * Allocates and deallocates RAM to processes.
   * Keeps processes isolated so they don‚Äôt overwrite each other‚Äôs memory.

3. **Device Management**

   * Provides drivers and handles communication between hardware devices (disk, network, keyboard, etc.) and software.

4. **File System Management**

   * Manages files on storage (reading, writing, permissions, directory structure).

5. **System Calls / Interface**

   * Provides an API (system calls) for user programs to request services from the OS.

## üß© Types of Kernels

| Type            | Description                                                      | Examples          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Monolithic**  | All services run in a single large block of code in kernel space | Linux, Unix       |
| **Microkernel** | Minimal core in kernel space; most services run in user space    | Minix, QNX        |
| **Hybrid**      | Mix of both monolithic and microkernel designs                   | Windows NT, macOS |
| **Exokernel**   | Very small kernel giving apps direct hardware access             | Experimental OSs  |

## üñ•Ô∏è How it fits in the OS Architecture

```
+----------------------------+
|   User Applications        |
+----------------------------+
|   System Libraries (glibc) |
+----------------------------+
|   System Calls Interface   |
+----------------------------+
|   Kernel                   |
+----------------------------+
|   Hardware (CPU, RAM, etc) |
+----------------------------+
```

* Apps never talk directly to hardware ‚Äî they always go through the **kernel**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Boot Process Overview

```
+-------------+       +-----------+       +-----------+       +-------------+       +------------+
| Power On    | --->  | Firmware  | --->  | Bootloader| --->  |  Kernel      | --->  | Init/Systemd|
| (BIOS/UEFI) |       | POST check|       | (GRUB etc)|       | loaded to RAM|       | user space  |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step: How Kernel Loads into Memory

### 1. **Power On / Firmware Stage**

* When you turn on the computer, the **BIOS (legacy) or UEFI (modern)** firmware runs.
* It performs a **Power-On Self Test (POST)** to check RAM, CPU, and basic devices.
* Firmware then **locates the boot device** (HDD, SSD, USB, etc.) and reads the **first sector (MBR or EFI partition)**.

---

### 2. **Bootloader Stage**

* The **bootloader** (like **GRUB, LILO, or systemd-boot**) is loaded from disk.
* The bootloader‚Äôs job is to:

  * Load the **kernel image (vmlinuz)** from disk into memory.
  * Load the **initial RAM disk (initramfs)** which has essential drivers (like disk or filesystem drivers needed to mount the real root filesystem).
  * Pass kernel parameters (like `root=/dev/sda1`) to the kernel.

---

### 3. **Kernel Initialization Stage**

* The **kernel (vmlinuz)** is now in memory.
* It:

  * Decompresses itself (since it‚Äôs stored compressed on disk).
  * Initializes memory management, CPU schedulers, and hardware drivers.
  * Mounts the temporary **initramfs** as the root filesystem.
  * Loads any required modules from initramfs.
  * Mounts the actual root filesystem (e.g., `/` on your disk).

---

### 4. **Init / Systemd Stage**

* Once kernel has mounted the real root filesystem:

  * It executes the first **user-space process**, traditionally called **`init`**, now usually **`systemd`**.
* `systemd` then:

  * Starts background services (daemons).
  * Starts login terminals / graphical login managers.
  * Brings the system to the desired runlevel (multi-user, GUI, etc.).

---

## üìå In Short

* BIOS/UEFI loads ‚Üí Bootloader loads ‚Üí Kernel loads into RAM ‚Üí Kernel starts `init` ‚Üí OS is ready.

---

# üêß What is Linux?

* **Linux is technically a **kernel** ‚Äî not a full operating system.**
* The **Linux kernel** is the **core program** that talks directly to the hardware and manages CPU, memory, devices, and system calls.

However‚Ä¶

* When people say **‚ÄúLinux‚Äù in everyday usage**, they usually mean a **Linux-based operating system** (like Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch, etc.).
* These are called **Linux distributions (distros)**, and they include:

  * The **Linux kernel**
  * **GNU system utilities & libraries** (shell, compiler, file tools, etc.)
  * Package managers
  * Desktop environments or servers
  * Other software

## üìå So, to summarize:

| Term                              | Description                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Linux (Kernel)**                | The core of the OS, manages hardware, processes, memory.                               |
| **Linux-based OS (Distribution)** | A complete operating system built using the Linux kernel + GNU tools + other software. |

**Example distributions:** Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch, RHEL, openSUSE

## üì¶ Structure of a Linux-based OS

```
+-----------------------------------+
|  User Applications                |
+-----------------------------------+
|  GNU Utilities / System Libraries |
+-----------------------------------+
|  Linux Kernel                     |
+-----------------------------------+
|  Hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk, etc.)  |
+-----------------------------------+
```

‚úÖ **Bottom line:**

* **Linux = kernel.**
* **Ubuntu/Fedora/Debian/etc. = full OS (built on Linux kernel).**
